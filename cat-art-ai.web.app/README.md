Rate the *awesomeness* artistic interpretations of cats and have your own art rated.

We build a trained a convolutional neural network to predict the *awesomeness* of cat art. We do this by crowd sourcing binary ratings of cat art.

View the online [demo](https://cat-art-duel.web.app). Feel free to rate photos and try your own!

# Training the model

We used a [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GBwxqWsHv6UZadnJ3Rr3avp79-g90GAL?usp=sharing) to train a Tensorflow model. The model is trained in python and converted for Javascript use.

# Build the code

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
